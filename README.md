# AutoGroqâ„¢

AutoGroq is a groundbreaking tool that revolutionizes the way users interact with AI assistants. By dynamically generating tailored teams of AI agents based on your project requirements, AutoGroq eliminates the need for manual configuration and allows you to tackle any question, problem, or project with ease and efficiency.

## NEW THIS WEEK:  SKILL GENERATION!

## Why AutoGroq?

AutoGroq was born out of the realization that the traditional approach to building AI agents was backwards. Instead of creating agents in anticipation of problems, AutoGroq uses the syntax of the users' needs as the basis for constructing the perfect AI team. It's how we wished Autogen worked from the very beginning.

With AutoGroq, a fully configured workflow, team of agents, and skillset are just a few clicks and a couple of minutes away, without any programming necessary. Our rapidly growing user base of nearly 8000 developers is a testament to the power and effectiveness of AutoGroq.

## Getting Started

To get started with AutoGroq, follow these steps:

1. Install Autogen following Matt Berman's instructions:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUEFwUU0IfE
2. Install Mini-conda:  https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/
3. Open a command prompt and run the following commands:

```winbatch
conda create -n AutoGroq python=3.11
conda activate AutoGroq
git clone https://github.com/jgravelle/AutoGroq.git
cd AutoGroq
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run AutoGroq\main.py
```

## Configuration

To customize the configurations for your local environment, follow these steps:  
  
1. Create a new file called `config_local.py` in the same directory as `config.py`.  
2. Copy the contents of `config_local.py.example` into `config_local.py`.  
3. Modify the values in `config_local.py` according to your specific setup, such as API keys and URLs.  
4. Save the `config_local.py` file.  
  
Note: The `config_local.py` file is not tracked by Git, so your customizations will not be overwritten when pulling updates from the repository.  
  
## How It Works

1. **Initiation**: Begin by entering your query or request in the designated input area.
2. **Engagement**: Click the "Begin" button to initiate the interaction. AutoGroq will rephrase your request and generate the appropriate expert agents.
3. **Interaction**: Select an expert agent to receive specialized assistance tailored to your needs.
4. **Dialogue**: Continue the conversation by providing additional input or context as required, guiding the flow of information.
5. **Review**: The "Discussion" section will display your dialogue history, while the "Whiteboard" section will showcase any extracted code snippets.
6. **Reset**: Use the "Reset" button to clear the current conversation and start a new one whenever needed.
